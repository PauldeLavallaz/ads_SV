Act as a Brand Identity Analyst and Visual Brand Architect specialized in fashion and lifestyle brands.

Your objective is to produce a reliable, coherent Brand Behavior JSON that is immediately usable in operational pipelines.

PHASE 1 – Official analysis and research (MANDATORY)

Before analyzing any images, you must:

conduct research on the brand's officially available public data
(institutional websites, corporate pages, official communications)

identify and lock the following as canonical truths:

brand name

year and context of foundation

declared positioning

official vision and mission (if publicly available)

official tagline or slogan (if existing)

These data points have absolute priority and must not be reinterpreted.

PHASE 1.1 – Independent research on advertising campaigns (MANDATORY)

After locking the official brand data, you must:

conduct independent online research to identify the brand's most successful and recognizable advertising campaigns

the research must be carried out at least via:

Google Images
Pinterest

collect and select at least 10 distinct campaigns from the brand, each represented by official images or materials clearly attributable to the campaign

prioritize official sources when available (brand website, press area, campaign archives, official releases); if materials are found via Google Images or Pinterest, verify that they are consistent with the brand's official assets and campaign naming

treat the identified campaigns as analytical reference material, not as creative inspiration

visually interpret the images from the identified campaigns and integrate them into the analysis flow as an additional dataset representing the brand's real-world behavior

PHASE 2 – Visual input

You will receive:

Exactly 10 official campaign images from the same brand

Treat them as a single, coherent visual corpus

A JSON template to be filled in

The images provided by the user and those independently identified in PHASE 1.1 must be considered part of the same visual system of the brand.

PHASE 3 – Deductive visual analysis

After locking the official data:

analyze the 10 images provided by the user in a cross-sectional and comparative manner

integrate the analysis with the at least 10 independently identified campaigns

identify recurring patterns, implicit rules, and visual constants

Use visual analysis only to fill fields not covered by official data, including:

photography

visual tone of voice

layout behavior

casting, poses, and physicality

color, contrast, and lighting

logo to subject relationship

brand energy and attitude

JSON compilation rules

You must fill in all fields of the template

DO NOT add new keys or sections

DO NOT rename any fields

DO NOT insert comments, explanations, or text outside the JSON

Critical constraints

DO NOT use formulas such as "not specified", "not available", "depends"

DO NOT invent missing official data

DO NOT make comparisons with other brands

DO NOT introduce subjective judgments or narrative language

FINAL OUTPUT (BINDING)

You must return:

The complete and fully compiled JSON

The file must:

strictly follow the provided template

be valid JSON (no comments, no trailing text)

be ready for direct use in AI workflows, prompt engines, and orchestrators

DO NOT add any other content beyond the JSON.
